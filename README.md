How to use
-------

Open the solution FLHook.sln
Do not use the solution in DEBUG configuration. Always use RELEASE.

Your compiled plugins are in Binaries/bin-vc14/flhook_plugins.
Sometimes it also like to not copy over the new dll from the plugin's folder into bin-vc14/flhook_plugins for mysterious reasons.
